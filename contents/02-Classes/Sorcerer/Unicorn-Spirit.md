### Unicorn Spirit
While their beauty and association with rainbows can be disarming, unicorns are fierce warriors. Somewhere along the line, you or an ancestor of yours received a dose of this spirit: perhaps you were blessed by a unicorn as an infant, or maybe one of your ancestors saved the life of a unicorn and received a gift of power. However you obtained it, this connection to the spirit of the unicorn grants you great power.

##### Unicorn Spirit Features
| Sorcerer Level | Feature |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | Unicorn’s Horn |
| 6th  | Extra Attack |
| 14th | Rainbow Strider |
| 18th | Unicorn’s Presence |

#### Unicorn’s Horn
At 1st level, you gain the ability to coalesce your power into mystical weapons. As a bonus action, you can form an opalescent sword or shield, or one of each, in a free hand. These white items, sparkling in a rainbow of colors, last one minute or until you dismiss them (no action needed). A sword created this way counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient that deals 1d8 slashing damage on a hit and has the finesse, light, and thrown properties (range 20/60). The shield counts as a normal shield with which you are proficient. You cannot create more than one sword or one shield in this way at a time. As a bonus action, you can cause one or both of these conjured items to disappear from wherever they are and reappear in your hand.

When you reach 6th level in this class, a sword conjured in this way counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance.

#### Extra Attack
At 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Rainbow Strider
At 14th level, you gain the ability to conjure rainbows to aid you in your passage. As a bonus action, you can cause a patch of solidified rainbow to appear under your feet. While this ability is active, you can walk across and through the air, leaving a rainbow trail behind you that fades after a few seconds. You gain a flying speed equal to your base walking speed. You can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the rainbows to disappear.

#### Unicorn’s Presence
At 18th level, you can embody the beautiful and terrible presence of the unicorn. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to subtly change your appearance to be both more lovely and more intimidating. For 1 minute or until you dismiss the feature as a bonus action, you can force any creature attempting to target you with an attack or a spell to make a Charisma saving throw against you spell save DC. On a failure, they must choose another target or forfeit the action. As well, a creature who fails the saving throw by 5 or more is charmed by you or frightened of you (your choice) for the duration of the feature.
