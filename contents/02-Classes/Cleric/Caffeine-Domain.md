#### Accelerated Action
Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn to draw on your caffeine infused essence to act quickly. 

Once per turn, you can choose to take an additional action. This action can only be used to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, ~~Hide~~, Help, or Use an Object action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest

#### Channel Divinity: 
Temp hp equal to wis mod plus cleric level to 6 allies in 30 ft (still needs formalized wording) 

also could make it anyone with temp hp from the channel divinity can't be forced to sleep

wait, make it so you don't need to sleep at level 1, then make the channel divinity prevent anyone under its effect from being forced to sleep

#### Stimulant Injection
Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to touch a willing creature other than yourself and give it a burst of energy. The creature can add 1d8 to its initiative rolls for 1 hour, or until you use this feature again.

#### Potent Spellcasting
Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### 17th Level Feature (5 Hour Energy?)
