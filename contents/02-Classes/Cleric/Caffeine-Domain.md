### Caffeine Domain
Flavour text goes here.

##### Caffeine Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | Domain Spells, Accelerated Action |
| 2nd  | Channel Divinity:  |
| 6th  | Stimulant Injection |
| 8th  | Potent Spellcasting |
| 17th | 17th Level Feature |

#### Domain Spells
You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Caffeine Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.

##### Caffeine Domain Spells
| Cleric Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | *expeditious retreat, false life* |
| 3rd  | *blur, enhance ability* |
| 5th  | *catnap, haste* |
| 7th  | *freedom of movement, sickening radiance* |
| 9th  | *animate objects, steel wind strike* |

#### Accelerated Action
Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn to draw on your caffeine infused essence to act quickly. 

Once per turn, you can choose to take an additional action. This action can only be used to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, ~~Hide~~, Help, or Use an Object action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest

#### Channel Divinity: 
Temp hp equal to wis mod plus cleric level to you and 6 allies in 30 ft (still needs formalized wording) 

also could make it anyone with temp hp from the channel divinity can't be forced to sleep

wait, make it so you don't need to sleep at level 1, then make the channel divinity prevent anyone under its effect from being forced to sleep

RULES REMINDER: Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest. (PHB 198)

#### Stimulant Injection
Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to touch a willing creature other than yourself and give it a burst of energy. The creature can add 1d8 to its initiative rolls for 1 hour, or until you use this feature again.

#### Potent Spellcasting
Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### 17th Level Feature (5 Hour Energy?)
Something to do with time stop maybe?
You become immune to the exhausted condition?
